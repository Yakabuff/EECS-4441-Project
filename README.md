Instructions:

In the phrase files, there are a few reserved words in which you are supposed to use the hotkeys to type. Do not cheat and type them out manually:

- Up
- Down
- Right
- Left
- PgUp
- PgDn
- Home
- End
- Backspace
- Enter
- Del

Symbols in the script:
- `+` is Shift
- `^` is Control
- `!` is Alt

eg: `+^!g` is equivalent to pressing Shift-Control-Alt g

Load these phrases into: http://www.yorku.ca/mack/ExperimentSoftware/TypingTestExperiment.jar

Install AutoHotKey and run the script. Use `script.ahk` for the shifted QWERTY layout and `normal_qwerty.ahk` for the default qwerty layout.

Note:

- You will notice that some keys like PageUp output the word `PgUp` instead of actually performing its intended task. This is intentional the typing test software does have any use for these keys. 

- For laptops, you may not be able to access hotkeys involving the function keys eg: `+F1`. You will need to use the `fn` key in conjunction with the modifier in order to use that hotkey.

- Make sure to close the script after you're done with a trial
